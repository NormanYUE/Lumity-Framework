# Lumity Framework

[中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Lumity Framework is a DLL-only Unity package for Unity 2022.3.62f2 or newer.

## Usage

Add `LumityBootstrap` to the first scene. Built-in managers are registered under the bootstrap and can be accessed through the global `Lumity` facade:

```csharp
Lumity.Event
Lumity.ObjectPool
Lumity.Config
Lumity.Fsm
Lumity.UI
Lumity.Resource
```

Version 0.2.0 provides the manager bootstrap foundation, manager skeletons, cached static manager access, and custom manager support. Full manager features are intentionally added in later releases.

## Custom Managers

Custom managers inherit `ManagerBase`. Place them under `LumityBootstrap`, or create them during startup with:

```csharp
Lumity.EnsureManager<MyCustomManager>();
```

Built-in manager properties and generated custom manager properties use cached static fields. They are assigned during startup and do not perform a registry lookup on every access.

For HybridCLR hot update projects, generate a project-side facade such as `GameLumity` into the hot update assembly:

```csharp
GameLumity.Initialize();
GameLumity.MyCustom.DoSomething();
```
